Depending on the dinner party I say that I am a marine scientist, a soundscape ecologist, a marine mammal biologist, a conservation biologist, depends on my mood and audience. In my research I focus on the soundscape or acoustic environment of critical areas for marine mammals. Right now I study the soundscape of Hawaiian spinner dolphin resting bays.

In the past month I have been working on 
* writing up my dissertation
* submitting manuscripts and preparing manuscripts for submission
* working on my story for my dissertation Chapter 3.

My three most important tools/strategies I use for organizing my work are using well-named Dropbox folders and changing the date every time I work on a link. A co-author taught me this during a manuscript writing process and also encouraged when collaborators work on something to send it back with initials indicating it was a version edited by ____. I also try to use READ_ME files that are well linked and comments in R scripts.

##Question for Heather
What are two pieces of advice you'd offer scientists planning community outreach?
